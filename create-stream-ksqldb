--- STEP 1 --- crete demo-car strem to populate the required data into the stream which can can be used for enrichment later--

CREATE STREAM demo_car_stream (
    OWNER_ID VARCHAR,
    OWNER_NAME VARCHAR,
    CAR_MODEL VARCHAR,
    CLAIM_AMOUNT DOUBLE,
    NUM_CLAIMS INT,
    RISK_SCORE INT,
    TRAFFIC_VIOLATIONS INT,
    SHOWROOM_PRICE DOUBLE,
    AGE_IN_YEARS INT,
    IDV DOUBLE,
    EVENT_TIMESTAMP BIGINT
) WITH (
    KAFKA_TOPIC='demo_car',
    VALUE_FORMAT='JSON',
    TIMESTAMP='EVENT_TIMESTAMP'
);

--STEP 2 -- create the enriched stream for premium calculation

CREATE STREAM demo_car_premium WITH (
    KAFKA_TOPIC='demo_car_premium',
    PARTITIONS=6
) AS
SELECT OWNER_NAME,
       CAR_MODEL,
       RISK_SCORE,
       IDV,
       CASE
           WHEN RISK_SCORE >= 4 THEN IDV * 0.04
           WHEN RISK_SCORE = 3 THEN IDV * 0.03
           WHEN RISK_SCORE = 2 THEN IDV * 0.02
           WHEN RISK_SCORE = 1 THEN IDV * 0.01
           ELSE IDV * 0.01
       END AS PREMIUM,
       EVENT_TIMESTAMP
FROM demo_car_stream;
